Hi, Iâ€™m **Harish, a Doctoral Candidate in the Computer Science Department at Maynooth University, Ireland.**. My research focuses on Evolutionary Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Spatial Data Science (GIS), with applications in optimising complex systems. I hold an MSc in Data Science and Analytics and a BTech in Instrumentation and Control Engineering.

I have experience in both academia and industry, having worked as a Machine Learning Research Intern at AMD, where I developed neural network performance projection models for FPGA architectures. Additionally, I have experience as a Teaching Assistant and Lab Demonstrator, leading tutorials for programming, algorithms, and spatial databases.
