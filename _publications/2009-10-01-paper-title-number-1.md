excerpt: 'In this paper, we proposed a method to create complex real-world networks using ESRI Shapefiles. The proposed method successfully resolves the issue of transforming ESRI Shapefile data into the necessary format for well-known graph analysis libraries like OSMnx and NetworkX. The proposed method enables researchers to quickly create graphical networks for their research projects, allowing them to test their theories on actual networks.'
