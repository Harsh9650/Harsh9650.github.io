A framework, Multi-node Evolutionary Neural Networks for Deep Learning (MENNDL) proposed by **Steven R. Young** was discussed as a method for automating network selection on computational clusters through hyper-parameter optimization performed via genetic algorithms. **Recommended citation:** Young, S.R., Rose, D.C., Karnowski, T.P., Lim, S.H. and Patton, R.M., 2015, November.
