excerpt: 'Applications such as vehicle navigation require access to multiple diverse paths rather than a single shortest path. In this paper, we propose a Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) following the island model for application to the K-Most Diverse Near-Shortest Paths (KMDNSP) problem. KMDNSP focuses on identifying a set of K paths that maintain structural dissimilarity while remaining close to the shortest or optimal path in overall path length. This makes KMDNSP very well-suited for applications requiring access to multiple possible route options.'
